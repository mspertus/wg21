      <h2>P1199R0</h2>
        <h3>A simple proposal for unifying generic and object-oriented programming</h3>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Mike Spertus, Symantec</h3>
    </section>
      <section class="slide"><h2>The topic</h2><blockquote>
  <p>Generic programming should just be normal programming</p>
  <p><cite>Meme (originally Bjarne Stroustrup?)</cite></p>
</blockquote></section>
<section class="slide">
    <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
    <h3 class="slide">Our answer<hr></h3>
    <h4 class="slide">Unify object-oriented runtime dispatch with generic
        compile-time dispatch <hr></h4>
    <h4 class="slide">Indeed, the first example in Bjarne Stroustrup's <em>Concepts for C++1y: the challenge</em> is
        that containers and iterators can be implemented either as generic types (like in C++ STL) or
        with virtual functions (like in Java)</h4>

      </section>
    <section class="slide"><h2>Terse notation is a step to unification</h2>
      <p>Indeed, the Concepts TS goes <em>all in</em> on unifying declarations:</p>
      <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(Shape &amp;s); // Valid whether Shape is a class or a concept</pre></pre>
      <p class="slide">Unfortunately, it was soon discovered that unification was not so simple</p>
      <ul><li class="slide">How parameters are passed with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> depends on whether
          <code>Shape</code> is a class or a concept</li>
        <li class="slide">Usage of <code>is_convex</code> 
            depends on whether <code>Shape</code>
          is a class or a concept (e.g., is <code>&amp;is_convex</code> valid?)</li>
          <li class="slide">The body of <code>is_convex</code> will differ greatly depending
        on whether <code>Shape</code> is a class or a concept</ul></section>
      <section class="slide"><h3>If all we can achieve is the appearance of unification without
          the reality of unification, we run the risk of just having a sort of Potemkin's village
          of unification</h3>
      <img src="https://i1.wp.com/madmikesamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/potemkin-village.jpg?ssl=1"/></section>
      <section class="slide"><h2>What would unification look like?</h2>
      <p>Of course, it would solve all of the above problems ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
      <ul class="slide"><li>How parameters are passed with universal references would be the same whether
          <code>Shape</code> is a class or a concept</li>
        <li>Usage of <code>is_convex</code> 
            would be the same whether <code>Shape</code>
          is a class or a concept</li>
          <li>The body of <code>is_convex</code> would be the same  whether <code>Shape</code> is a class or a concept</ul>
      <h3 class="slide">I claim these can all be achieved</h3>
      <p class="slide">Spoiler alert: I <em>love</em> P1141</p></section>
      <section class="slide"><h2>Motivating example</h2>
    <ul><li class="slide">When writing a program, one needs to make a very committal decision
        <li class="slide">Is <code>Shape</code> a base class with virtual functions or a concept?</li>
        <li class="slide">Depending on this choice, you will code in two very different ways (almost
            two different languages)
        <ul><li class="slide">If <code>Shape</code> is a class, <code>is_convex</code> will be an 
            ordinary function and the body can include statements like <code>new Shape();</code></li>
            <li class="slide">If <code>Shape</code> is a concept, <code>is_convex</code>
            will be a function template and the body of <code>is_convex</code> will be very different. For example,
            <code>new Shape</code> will no longer be legal</li></ul></li>
          <li class="slide"><strong>While having to make such a decision from the get-go is 
        likely premature, it is almost certainly impossible to change later, resulting
        in inflexible, brittle code</strong></li>
        <li class="slide"><strong>Likewise, if <code>is_convex</code> is a library function,
            users of the library will also be saddled to that decision, regardless of whether
            dynamic dispatch or performance is more important to them</strong></li></ul>
          <h3 class="slide">With this in mind, our standard for successful unification will
          be to support writing functions like <code>is_convex</code> that work the same
          whether <code>shape</code> is an OO base class or a generic concept</h3>
      </section>
      <section class="slide"><h2>The key idea</h2>
      <ul><li class="slide">The crucial insight to writing such &ldquo;class/concept agnostic code&rdquo;
          is that P1141 allows us to label
          that a declaration is to be deduced 
          <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(Shape auto &amp;s); // Shape is deduced</pre></pre></li>
          <li class="slide">P1141 tells what this means if <code>Shape</code>
          is a concept, now all we have to do is describe what it means when <code>Shape</code>
          is a class in a way that provides all of the requirements for unification</li>
          <li class="slide">To achieve this unification, we interpret <code>Shape auto</code> as a concept,
          even if <code>Shape</code> is a class</li>
          <li class="slide">The question is: Which Concept?</li>
          <li class="slide">Fortunately, there is only one reasonable choice for this &lt;drum roll&gt;</li>
          </ul></section>
<section class="slide"><h2>The interpretation of <code>Shape auto</code></h2>
      <ul><li class="slide">In object-oriented programming a function taking a <code>Shape &amp;</code> 
          represents the concept (i.e., notion) that it
          can receive objects of any type that inherits from <code>Shape</code>, so we will just make
          that our concepts interpretation!</li>
    <li class="slide">In other words, if <code>Shape</code> is a class, then define the
          concept <code>inherits_from_Shape</code> by 
          <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;typename T> 
concept bool inherits_from_Shape = is_convertible_v&lt;T *, Shape *>;</pre></pre>
          and we propose that the compiler rewrite <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(Shape auto &amp;s);</pre></pre>
          as the constrained concepts declaration
          <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(inherits_from_Shape auto &amp;s);</pre></pre></li></ul></section>
<section class="slide"><h2>What does that give us?</h2>
<ul><li class="slide">Actually, just what we need!</li>
<li class="slide">If <code>Shape</code> is a class
    <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(Shape auto &amp;s);</pre></pre>
    can be called with any object that inherits from <code>Shape</code>, just the same as the familiar
    <code><pre><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(Shape &amp;s);</pre></pre></code></li>
<li class="slide">But since it has been reinterpreted as the <code>inherits_from_Shape</code>
    concept, it is a function template, treats &amp;&amp; as a universal reference, etc.
    just like it would if <code>Shape</code> were a concept!</li>
<li class="slide">This means that if later we realize we should have made <code>Shape</code> a concept with the
    same methods (e.g., for 
    better performance), the usage of <code>is_convex</code> doesn't change at all!</li>
<li class="slide">In other words, we have successfully unified the signature!</li></ul>
</section>
<section class="slide"><h2>What about the function body?</h2>
<ul><li class="slide">Of course, if we riddle the body of <code>is_convex</code> with the assumption
    that <code>Shape</code> is a class, then we will be back to having a &ldquo;Potemkin Village Unification&rdquo;</li>
<li class="slide">So we just do exactly the same thing for the body we did for the signature!</li>
<li class="slide">Replace all occurrences of <code>Shape</code> in the body with the
    <code>inherits_from_shape</code> concept and now any constructs that don't work for concepts
    are prohibited, allowing us to switch <code>Shape</code> to a concept later</li>
    <li class="slide">If we are uncomfortable with silently doing this, we can require that all occurrences
    of <code>Shape</code> within the body are followed by <code>auto</code></li>
    <li class="slide"><pre>bool is_convex(Shape auto &amp;s) {
  <del>Shape *x = new Shape;</del> // Ill-formed! Assumes Shape is a class
  pair p(s, 7); // OK. Does not assume <code>Shape</code> is a class
  Shape auto &amp;s2 = convex_hull(s); // Also ok
  ...
}</pre></li></ul></section>
      <section class="slide"><h2>Putting it together</h2>
<p>To sum up, our proposal is simply</p>
<ul><li>Wherever <code><em>classname</em> auto</code> occurs,
    replace it with <code><em>inherits_from_classname</em> auto</code></li>
  <li>If <code><em>classname</em> auto</code> occurs in a function signature,
    all occurrences of <code><em>classname</em></code> in the body must be followed by
    <code>auto</code> (this may be relaxed if desired)</li></ul>
          <div class="slide"><p>That's pretty much it. </p></div> 
          <p class="slide">Let's illustrate with another example</p></section>
     <section class="slide"><h2>Another example</h2>
      <p>Here is a function taking two arguments</p>
      <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">// Want to work identically whether Shape is a concept or type
bool sameShapeMaybeDifferentPosition(Shape auto const &amp;s1, Shape auto const &amp;s2) {   
   Shape auto const &amp;s1Translated = s1 - s1.lower_left();
   Shape auto const &amp;s2Translated = s2 - s2.lower_left();
   return s1Translated == s2Translated;
}</pre></pre>
         <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul><li>This code works equally well whether <code>Shape</code> is a base class with virtual
    functions or a concept requiring the same methods, so it is easy to switch between them to tune
    the tradeoffs between compile-time and runtime dispatch or if circumstances change later</li>
    <li>This example only works because of independent binding (another reason I prefer P1141 over
    the concepts TS) because in object-oriented programming, you could compare two different shapes (e.g.,
    a rectangle and a triangle) as long as they both inherit from <code>Shape</code></li></ul></section>
      <section class="slide"><h2>Notes</h2>
<ul><li>With this proposal, uses of <code>C auto</code> are agnostic
    as to whether <code>C</code> is a class with virtual functions or a concept specifying
    the same semantics</li>
    <li>Therefore, we believe that it achieves all of the goals outlined at the
    beginning of this presentation, providing semantic unification along with syntactic unification
    (no Potemkin village here!)</li>
    <li>Of course, if you know that <code>C</code> will always be a class and have no interest in
    unification, you can simply ignore this proposal since it only applies if <code>C</code> is 
    followed by <code>auto</code>
    <pre><pre class="brush:cpp">void f(C c); // Works as always. Not a function template</pre></pre><p>so
        there is no impact when not used</p></li>
    <li>As the details of P1141 are finalized, we would encourage that the <code>auto</code> sigil
          be allowed (but not necessarily required) after a concept name as much as possible within a function body
          to maximize the functionality of class/concept agnostic code</li>
          <li>We should make sure that writing code for concepts is not too much harder than
    writing code for classes, minimizing the frustration of writing class/concept agnostic code
<ul><li>Of course, that is already important for concepts anyway!</li>
<li>P1168R0 gives our approach to addressing this (whether or not the present paper is accepted)</li></ul></li></ul></section>
